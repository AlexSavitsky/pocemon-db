# Simple Pocemon DB

Created for a test task.
Uses for [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get data and display it on this app's page.

To run the application - clone or download the repository to your local machine, open in a code editor and install the packages using `npm i` or `yarn add`.

Now you can run the project with `npm start` command and see it at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
